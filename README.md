# ProForma Proteoform Notation

Published in the Journal of Proteome Research [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00851).

## Releases and Working Version

A numbered version of the standard notation PDF is found [here](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/releases).

The work-in-progress version of the standard is [here](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/blob/master/Standard.md).

## Introduction

Our subcommittee was tasked to propose a notation that can be used to write the sequence
of a given proteoform. A proteoform is a specific set of amino acids arranged in a particular order,
which may be further modified (cotranslationally, posttranslationally, or chemically) at designated
locations. We met via phone, working on electronically shared documents, for an hour a week
between November and December 2016. Our task is described below:

Task: provide an unambiguous notation for writing an individual proteoform. The notation must:
* Be Human readable. Suitable for display in written document or presentation.
* Be Machine parsable.
* Contain the complete amino acid sequence of the observed proteoform
* Specify the location and type of each modification.

## Contributions

### Notation rules
We welcome comments, suggestions and extensions to the notation to ensure its widespread usage. They can be submitted as [issues](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/issues) and will then be discussed to find a common solution.

### Software tools

Software such as stand-alone tools, plugins, libraries can be added via pull requests and will be carefully evaluated by the committee. 

[Validator software](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/validator-software) checks a file with proteoform sequences for inconsistencies such as wrong usage of the nomenclature rules.

[Convertors](https://github.com/topdownproteomics/proteoform-nomenclature-standard/convertors) allow conversion to and from files containing files annotated according to the notation.
